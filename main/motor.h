/**
 * Represents a PWM controlled motor
 * The motor accepts 2 pins, one pwm and one non-pwm, controlled as in http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/H-Bridge/H-Bridge-1.html design 3.
 * Pins should be mirrowed across the 2 motors.
 * When both are same signal, brake.
 * The dir pin controls direction (0 forwards, 1 backward), while the pwm pin does pwm using the dir value as off and the opposite value as on
 *
 * Speed control logic flips the pwm period to set the baseline value to 1 when dir is one
